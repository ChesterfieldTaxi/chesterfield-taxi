# Sequential Execution Tasks

## Phase 1: Initialization
- [x] Initialize Vite project configured with React Router v7 (Framework Mode).
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS v4.

## Phase 2: Scaffolding App Structure
- [x] Scaffold `app/config/` (for UI, field schemas, and pricing configs).
- [x] Scaffold `app/core/types/` (TypeScript interfaces, Domain Models).
- [x] Scaffold `app/core/services/` (Business logic, IBookingService, Firebase integrations).
- [x] Scaffold `app/components/ui/` (Reusable, presentational components).
- [x] Scaffold `app/components/domain/` (Business-aware components).

## Phase 3: Core Interfaces & Configuration
- [x] Define the `Universal Field Schema` interface in `app/core/types/`.
- [x] Define the `IBookingService` interface in `app/core/services/`.
- [x] Create the foundational JSON configs in `app/config/` for the booking form steps.

## Phase 4: State Machine & Data Models
- [x] Define the `Trip` type and its Firestore state machine constraints (`pending` -> `offered` -> `assigned` -> `completed`).
- [x] Define the targeting arrays structure specifically for `offeredToIds`.

## Phase 5: Logic Implementation
- [x] Implement the `Prioritized Pricing Pipeline` relying strictly on pure functions.
- [x] Set up Server-side Google Maps routing function utilities.

## Phase 6: External Integrations
- [x] Set up Firebase (Firestore/Auth) logic to implement the `IBookingService`.
- [x] Integrate Resend for transactional email dispatch.

## Phase 7: UI Assembly
- [x] Build and wire up the Multi-step config-driven booking form using the `app/config/` files.

## Phase 8: Deployment
- [x] Deploy the Phase 1 web application to Vercel and verify environment variables.
