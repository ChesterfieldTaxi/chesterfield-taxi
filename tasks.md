# Sequential Execution Tasks

## Phase 1: Initialization
- [x] Initialize Vite project configured with React Router v7 (Framework Mode).
- [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS v4.

## Phase 2: Scaffolding App Structure
- [x] Scaffold `app/config/` (for UI, field schemas, and pricing configs).
- [x] Scaffold `app/core/types/` (TypeScript interfaces, Domain Models).
- [x] Scaffold `app/core/services/` (Business logic, IBookingService, Firebase integrations).
- [x] Scaffold `app/components/ui/` (Reusable, presentational components).
- [x] Scaffold `app/components/domain/` (Business-aware components).

## Phase 3: Core Interfaces & Configuration
- [x] Define the `Universal Field Schema` interface in `app/core/types/`.
- [x] Define the `IBookingService` interface in `app/core/services/`.
- [x] Create the foundational JSON configs in `app/config/` for the booking form steps.

## Phase 4: State Machine & Data Models
- [x] Define the `Trip` type and its Firestore state machine constraints (`pending` -> `offered` -> `assigned` -> `completed`).
- [x] Define the targeting arrays structure specifically for `offeredToIds`.

## Phase 5: Logic Implementation
- [x] Implement the `Prioritized Pricing Pipeline` relying strictly on pure functions.
- [x] Set up Server-side Google Maps routing function utilities.

## Phase 6: External Integrations
- [x] Set up Firebase (Firestore/Auth) logic to implement the `IBookingService`.
- [x] Integrate Resend for transactional email dispatch.

## Phase 7: UI Assembly
- [x] Build and wire up the Multi-step config-driven booking form using the `app/config/` files.

## Phase 8: Deployment
- [x] Deploy the Phase 1 web application to Vercel and verify environment variables.

## Phase 9: Admin Configuration Panel & Dynamic Firestore Sync
- [x] 9.1 Define AppSettings Firestore schema & IAdminConfigService interfaces in `app/core/types/config.ts`.
- [x] 9.2 Implement `AdminConfigService` in `app/core/services/config/admin-config.service.ts` with Firestore `config/appSettings` sync and fallback.
- [x] 9.3 Refactor `getBookingService()` and `calculateQuote()` to dynamically hydrate pricing and vehicle multipliers from Firestore.
- [x] 9.4 Set up Firebase Auth route guards and tab navigation in `/admin` layout (`app/routes/admin.tsx`).
- [x] 9.5 Build Tab 1: General & Branding settings (Company contact info, hex color pickers, logo).
- [x] 9.6 Build Tab 2: Pricing & Rules controls (Base fare, per-mile rates, surge multiplier override).
- [x] 9.7 Build Tab 3: Fleet Management (Add, update, or remove vehicle specs and multipliers).
- [x] 9.8 Build Tab 4: Live Bookings monitor (Real-time Firestore trips stream and status transition actions).
- [x] 9.9 Implement `/admin/login` route (`app/routes/admin.login.tsx`) with Firebase Auth password authentication.
- [x] 9.10 Register admin routes in `app/routes.ts` and verify build with zero typecheck errors.
