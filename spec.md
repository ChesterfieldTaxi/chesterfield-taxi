# Specification: Functional Outcomes

## 1. Multi-Step Booking Process
The booking portal will guide the user through a sequential, config-driven flow:
1. **Pickup & Dropoff:** Location selection with autocomplete capabilities.
2. **Time Selection:** Options for ASAP or scheduled future bookings.
3. **Vehicle Selection:** Displaying vehicle tiers (e.g., Standard, Premium, XL, Wheelchair Accessible).
4. **Details:** Collecting passenger info, luggage counts, and special requests.
5. **Payment/Confirmation:** Final review and booking submission.

## 2. Server-Side Google Maps Routing
- Routing calculations (distance and duration) must be performed securely on the server or via serverless functions.
- The client-side should only display the results and map visuals, ensuring the pricing engine uses tamper-proof distance and time data from the backend.

## 3. Pure Functional Pricing Engine
- Pricing calculations will be handled entirely by a pure, deterministic functional engine.
- **Inputs:** Distance, Duration, Vehicle Type, Time of Day (for surge pricing), Base Fare.
- **Output:** Final quoted price.
- **Constraint:** The pricing engine must have no side effects (e.g., no database calls or external API mutations within the calculation functions).

## 4. Resend Email Dispatch
- Transactional emails will be sent reliably via Resend.
- **Triggers:** Booking confirmation (User), New booking alert (Admin/Console), and status updates (e.g., Driver Assigned).
