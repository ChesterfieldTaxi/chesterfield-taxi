# Specification: Functional Outcomes

## 1. Multi-Step Booking Process
The booking portal will guide the user through a sequential, config-driven flow:
1. **Pickup & Dropoff:** Location selection with autocomplete capabilities.
2. **Time Selection:** Options for ASAP or scheduled future bookings.
3. **Vehicle Selection:** Displaying vehicle tiers (e.g., Standard, Premium, XL, Wheelchair Accessible).
4. **Details:** Collecting passenger info, luggage counts, and special requests.
5. **Payment/Confirmation:** Final review and booking submission.

## 2. Server-Side Google Maps Routing
- Routing calculations (distance and duration) must be performed securely on the server or via serverless functions.
- The client-side should only display the results and map visuals, ensuring the pricing engine uses tamper-proof distance and time data from the backend.

## 3. Pure Functional Pricing Engine
- Pricing calculations will be handled entirely by a pure, deterministic functional engine.
- **Inputs:** Distance, Duration, Vehicle Type, Time of Day (for surge pricing), Base Fare.
- **Output:** Final quoted price.
- **Constraint:** The pricing engine must have no side effects (e.g., no database calls or external API mutations within the calculation functions).

## 4. Resend Email Dispatch
- Transactional emails will be sent reliably via Resend.
- **Triggers:** Booking confirmation (User), New booking alert (Admin/Console), and status updates (e.g., Driver Assigned).

## 5. Phase 9: Admin Configuration Panel & Dynamic Firestore Sync
- **Centralized App Settings in Firestore:** Global configuration stored at document `config/appSettings` containing:
  - `company`: name, phone, email, address.
  - `branding`: primaryColor, secondaryColor, logoUrl.
  - `pricing`: baseFare, perMileRate, airportFee, surgeMultiplier.
  - `vehicles`: array of editable vehicle tiers (`id`, `name`, `baseMultiplier`, `maxPassengers`, `maxLuggage`).
- **Client-Side Auth Route Guards:** Protection of `/admin` routes via Firebase Auth state listening (`onAuthStateChanged`). Unauthenticated visitors are redirected to `/admin/login`.
- **Dynamic Pricing & Fleet Hydration:** The pricing engine and booking service dynamically query and apply runtime settings from `config/appSettings`, with resilient fallback to default JSON configs when offline or unconfigured.
- **Interactive Multi-Tab Admin Portal:**
  - Tab 1: General & Branding (company contact info, color pickers, brand identity).
  - Tab 2: Pricing & Rules (base fare, mileage rate, airport surcharge, real-time surge multiplier override).
  - Tab 3: Fleet Management (add, edit, toggle, and delete vehicle tiers with custom capacity and fare multipliers).
  - Tab 4: Live Bookings (live stream of submitted trips from Firestore with status workflow controls).
## 6. Phase 10: Multi-Page Architecture & Site Navigation
- **SPA Multi-Route Architecture:** Refactor public routes into a responsive, multi-page experience powered by React Router v7 layout routes.
- **Persistent Public Layout Wrapper:**
  - `Navbar.tsx`: Responsive navigation header featuring company branding (`/`), dynamic navigation links (`Home`, `Services`, `About`, `Contact`), Admin Console link, prominent "Book Now" CTA (`/book`), and an animated mobile drawer menu.
  - `Footer.tsx`: Universal company disclosures, service area coverage directory, 24/7 dispatch phone and email contacts, quick links, and copyright notices.
- **Dedicated Page Routes:**
  - `app/routes/_index.tsx` (Home Landing Page): High-conversion landing page with hero banner, value proposition badges, instant rate estimation teaser, service area showcase, and direct `/book` CTAs.
  - `app/routes/book.tsx` (Dedicated Booking Portal): Distraction-free route hosting the complete 5-step interactive booking form wizard with live fare calculations.
  - `app/routes/services.tsx` (Services Overview): Detailed service breakdowns (Airport Transfers for Lambert STL & Spirit SUS, Corporate Billing Accounts, Event Transport, Hourly Charters) with vehicle tier specifications and booking CTAs.
  - `app/routes/about.tsx` (About Us): Company heritage in West County, safety certifications, driver vetting standards, and wheelchair accessibility (WAV) guarantees.
  - `app/routes/contact.tsx` (Contact & Support): 24/7 dispatch phone, direct email, business hours, service area coverage list, and an interactive inquiry contact form.
